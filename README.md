# Aegaeon

**Aegaeon Next is a rewrite of Aegaeon in Kotlin**

Aegaeon [<sup>W</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegaeon_(moon)) is an OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0 server implementation using spring boot.

The code is available under Apache 2.0 license and is currently under heavy development.
The project was inspired by [mitreid-connect](https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server).

The project was started with the goal of having a better understanding of OpenId / OAuth standard and has evolved to a project with the following goal :

- Creating an *opiniatre* implementation. i.e. Having sensible default and being pragmatic.
- Simple, fast and clean
- Being up-to-date
